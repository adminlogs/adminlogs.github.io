<h3>IPSec Phase 1</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In IPSec phase 1 a tunnel is created used to protect IPSec management traffic. This tunnel is bidirectional. Three steps are needed to create this tunnel.</p>
<h4>Step 1: Negotiate the IKE Phase 1 Tunnel</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two routers negotiate the Internet Key Exchange (IKEv1) Phase 1 tunnel. This can be done in one of the two modes, <u>Main mode</u> or <u>Aggreessive Mode</u>. Main mode is more secure than the Aggressive Mode and the Main mode uses more packets thans the Aggressive mode. Most current VPNs use by default the Main mode.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Five basic items need to be agreed upon between the two VPN devices/gateways for the IKE Phase 1 tunnel to succeed, as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hash algorithm</li>
  <li>Encryption algorithm</li>
  <li>Authentication method</li>
  <li>Lifetime</li>
  <li>Diffie-Hellman (DH) group</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step 2: Diffie Hellman Exchange</h4>
