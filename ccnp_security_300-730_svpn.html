GETVPN: Group Encrypted Transport VPN
  In a GETVPN setup, there isnâ€™t a need to negotiate point-to-point IPsec tunnels between members of a group; this means GETVPN is a tunnel-less option.
DMVPN: Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN)
  mGRE Multipoint GRE
FlexVPN:
  Cisco version of the IKEv2 standard offering for both site-to-site and remote access VPNs.
<h3>GETVPN Group Encrypted Transport VPN:</h3>
<p>
  Resolve the problem of the large number of security associations (SAs), GETVPN uses a single SA for all the group members. Using a single SA eliminates the hub-and-spoke solutions and partial mesh configurations. GETVPN protocol GDOI Group Domain Of Interpretation establishes the SA between the group members.
  GETVPN introduces the concept of <b>trusted group</b>, each VPN router in the trusted group trusts the other routers nad can send traffic to them. All the group members share the a common SA, this results in two distinct important advantages for GETVPN:
    Any group member can decrypt traffic encrypted by any other member.
    Tunnel negociation is not required because GETVPN is a non-tunnel/tunnel-less based solution.

  <h4>GDOI(Group Domain Of Interest) Protocol:</h4>
<p>
   RFC 6407, in GETVPN the router encrypts the payload and transmits the IP datagram with the original source and destination IP addresses.

  <p>
  GETVPN does not work in NAT environment, tis type of solution is rarely used across the public network such the internet. GETVPN is ideally suited for either MPLS network or a private IP netwok implementation in large entreprises and government entities.
  GETVPN supports IKEv1 and IKEv2.
  GETVPN has three primary components:
    Key Server.
    Group member.
    GDOI protocol.
  <h4>Key Server</h4>
    Is the most critical device in the GETPVN solution. The minimal components that should be configured on a key server:
     <ol>
     <li>IKE policy</li>
     <li>RSA key for rekeying</li>
     <li>IPSec policies</li>
     <li>Traffic classification</li>
     </ol>
  </p>
