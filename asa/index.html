<p>ASA mage is a compressed binary file pre-installed on the Flash of the device. The image get decompressed into RAM when the appliance boots-up. Security level is assigned to interfaces(physical/logical sub-interfaces) and it’s a number from 1 to 100 designating how trusted an interface is relative to another interface on the appliance. An interface with with higher security level can access an interface with a lower security level. On the other hand an interface with a lower security level cannot access an interface with a higher security level , without the explicit permission of a security rule (ACL).</p>
<p><strong>Security level 0</strong> is the lowest trusted security level and it is assigned by default to the <strong>outside</strong> interface of the firewall.</p>
<p><strong>Security levels 1 to 99</strong> can be assigned to perimeter security zones (DMZ Zone, Management Zone, Web Servers Zone ect).</p>
<p><strong>Security level 100</strong> is the most trusted security level and it is assigned by default to the <strong>inside</strong> interface on the firewall.</p>
