<p><strong>running-config</strong> is stored in <strong>RAM</strong><br>
<strong>startup-config</strong> is stored in <strong>Flash</strong></p>
<p>To save the current running-config we can use one of these two commands:</p>
<pre>ciscoasa# copy running-config startup-config</pre>
<pre>ciscoasa# write memory</pre>
<p>ASA mage is a compressed binary file pre-installed on the Flash of the device. The image get decompressed into RAM when the appliance boots-up. Security level is assigned to interfaces(physical/logical sub-interfaces) and it’s a number from 1 to 100 designating how trusted an interface is relative to another interface on the appliance. An interface with with higher security level can access an interface with a lower security level. On the other hand an interface with a lower security level cannot access an interface with a higher security level , without the explicit permission of a security rule (ACL).</p>
<p><strong>Security level 0</strong> is the lowest trusted security level and it is assigned by default to the <strong>outside</strong> interface of the firewall.</p>
<p><strong>Security levels 1 to 99</strong> can be assigned to perimeter security zones (DMZ Zone, Management Zone, Web Servers Zone ect).</p>
<p><strong>Security level 100</strong> is the most trusted security level and it is assigned by default to the <strong>inside</strong> interface on the firewall.</p>
<h3>Securing access to the ASA:</h3>
<h4>Configure a privileged level password:</h4>
<p>By default there is no password for accessing the ASA firewall, the first step in to configure privileged level password.</p>
<pre>ciscoasa(config)# enable password <em>mysecretpassword</em></pre>
<h4>Configure firewall hostname and domain-name:</h4>
<p>The default hostname of the Cisco ASA is ciscoasa without domain-name configured.</p>
<pre>ciscoasa(config)# hostname northen-fw
northern-fw(config)# end
northern-fw# show hostname
northern-fw
northern-fw# show hostname fqdn
northern-fw.adminlogs.local</pre>
